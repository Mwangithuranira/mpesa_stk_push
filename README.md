MPESA STK Push Service
This project implements a Node.js application for Safaricom MPESA STK Push functionality. Developed by Eng. Johnson Mwangi, it allows users to make payments directly from their mobile phones using Safaricom's MPESA API.

Features
üåü Token Generation: Securely generates access tokens using the MPESA Consumer Key and Secret.
üì≤ STK Push: Initiates an STK Push request to the user's mobile phone for seamless payment.
üîî Callback Handling: Processes payment notifications via a designated callback URL.
üåê Environment Variables Logging: Ensures all necessary configurations are correctly set.
